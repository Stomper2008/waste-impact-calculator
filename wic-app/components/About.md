### Project description

The Waste Impac Calculator (WIC) is a project of the Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality's Materials Management program. A video
introduction can be found [here](link).

WIC estimates the life cycle environmental impacts of solid waste
materials, and allows users to project the impact consequences of
changing waste management decisions.

The WIC framework can be used or expressed in multiple ways. The current
web app is one expression, but those with a knowledge of R can use the
framework to create their own custom analyses or apps.

### Soure code and impact factor download

-   The [github repository](link) contains source code for the entire
    Waste Impact Calculator framework, including but not limited to this
    app.
-   The impact factor database can be found in [this folder](link) of
    the github site. These factors will make more sense if you review
    the technical documentation above.
-   Contributions of data and code are welcome! Contact Martin Brown via
    [email](martin.brown@state.or.us) or the github repo.
