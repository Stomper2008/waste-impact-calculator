# Oregon DEQ files for the Waste Impact Calculator

These are Waste Impact Calculator (WIC) components and files used by Oregon DEQ to:

* create results using the scripted (i.e. non-interactive) version of the WIC model
* prepare and/or update data files utilized by the interactive Shiny app version of WIC model

## folders

**source_data** contains data used in the model but not directly imported from DEQ or internet databases.  These files include the impact factors and several crosswalk files essential for creating the inputs to later calculations.

**projects** contains folders with specific analyses and procedures performed by DEQ

* __arr_scenarios_deq_factors__ calculates the life cycle impacts of Oregon's solid waste stream under three scenarios described by the "alternative recovery rate" law, and uses original impact factors generated by Oregon DEQ to do so.
* __arr_scenarios_warm_factors__ is similar to above, but uses impact factors from US EPA's WARM model to do so.
